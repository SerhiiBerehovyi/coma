My solutions for programming exercises of course computer-oriented mathematics. The course is taught in Python and is divided in two Semesters. Themes in course: 
* Basic programming
* OOP
* Basic algorithms (sorting, shortest paths in graphs, Huffman codes, hashing)
* Basic data structures (stacks, queues, lists, binary trees, hash tables) 
* Basics of theoretical computer science (formal computer model, predictability and complexity theory) 


All information about university and authors of PA's was removed by request of the lecturer.
